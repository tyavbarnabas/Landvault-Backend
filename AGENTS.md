# landvault-backend

Spring Boot backend for **LandVault**, a multi-tenant PropTech land-investment platform (Nigeria + diaspora buyers). This project is the real backend for the frontend prototype at:

```
~/landvault   (repo: figma-make-app / LandVault client frontend, React + Vite + Tailwind)
```

Read `~/landvault/AGENTS.md` and `~/landvault/INTEGRATION.md` before designing any endpoint — the frontend already defines the contract this backend must satisfy (see `API_CONTRACT.md` in this repo, derived from it). Read `~/landvault/CLAUDE.md`'s project memory equivalents too if working from a Claude Code session — a fresh session here starts with no memory of the frontend's design decisions, so re-derive from those files rather than guessing.

## What LandVault is

An enterprise multi-tenant platform: **Super Admin** (platform operator) → **Tenant** (a land-developer company, with branches) → **Client** (buyer). Buyers browse/reserve/purchase plots within estates; developers manage their estate inventory and buyer transactions; Super Admin verifies tenants, governs the public marketplace, and watches platform health. The frontend repo currently implements only the client-facing surface plus a slice of the Super Admin console (tenant verification lifecycle, marketplace listing-conflict detection). The developer portal and the rest of Super Admin are speced (see the frontend's project memory / backlog docs) but not built anywhere yet — this backend is greenfield for all of it.

## Current state of this project

Fresh Spring Initializr scaffold, nothing domain-specific built yet:
- `LandvaultBackendApplication.java` — bare `@SpringBootApplication` entrypoint
- `application.properties` — empty
- No entities, controllers, repositories, or Liquibase changelogs yet

## Stack

- **Spring Boot 4.1.1**, Java 21
- **Spring Data JPA** + **Liquibase** for migrations (put changelogs under `src/main/resources/db/changelog/`; never hand-edit the schema outside Liquibase once real data exists)
- **Spring Modulith** (core + JPA starters) — structure packages as modules, one per domain (see below), with Modulith's application-module boundaries enforced by its test starter rather than an honor system
- **PostgreSQL** — and specifically, the plot-geometry and listing-conflict-detection work (see below) depends on **PostGIS**, not just plain Postgres — provision the Postgres instance with the PostGIS extension enabled
- **springdoc-openapi** (Swagger UI) for the actual API docs once endpoints exist
- Validation, WebMVC, Lombok

## Suggested module boundaries

One Modulith application module per domain, matching the frontend's one-service-file-per-domain split (`~/landvault/src/services/*.ts`):

`auth`, `tenants` (+ branches, verification, audit log), `estates` (+ plots, price tiers), `marketplace` (+ public listing projection, unified feed, listing-conflict detection), `checkout` (+ transactions, reservations), `portfolio` (+ owned plots, payments, installment schedules), `resale`, `upgrade`, `documents`, `kyc`, `inspections`, `disputes`, `reviews`, `syndicates`, `notifications`, `platform-metrics` (Super Admin).

## Auth & permissions model to match

- Two roles today: `"client" | "super_admin"` — plus a **string permission-slug array** per user (e.g. `client.portfolio.view`, `admin.tenants.manage`), not just a role check. See `~/landvault/src/services/authService.ts` for the exact slugs already assumed by the frontend's route/zone gating.
- Bearer token auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request; `POST /api/auth/login` returns `{ user, token }`; `POST /api/auth/refresh` re-issues a token (frontend calls this with `credentials: "include"`, anticipating an httpOnly-cookie-based refresh — the frontend's own token storage is `localStorage`, which it flags as an XSS exposure it can't fix unilaterally; this backend's cookie/CORS/CSRF design decides how refresh actually gets secured).
- Super Admin is never self-registered — seed the first Super Admin account directly (matches the frontend's mock `admin@landvault.com` account, which stands in for a seeded row, not a signup path).

## Domain rules worth preserving (the frontend enforces these client-side against mock data; the backend is the real source of truth for all of them)

- **Append-only history, never hard-delete**: `Document.supersedes`, `Tenant.verificationHistory`, `OwnedPlot.supersedes` (set by upgrade/swap) are all chains, not mutable single records. A "void" or "reissue" is a new row referencing the old one, never a delete or in-place edit.
- **Two-step payment verification**: a payment/transaction moves through a "webhook/gateway confirmed" state (`pending_verification`) before a Finance-role action marks it `confirmed`/`verified`. Never auto-confirm a payment.
- **Marketplace publication gate**: an `Estate` only appears on the public marketplace if its owning `Tenant` clears verification AND the estate itself has `published: true` — a developer can pull one listing without touching tenant status.
- **Upgrade/swap delta pricing is signed** — a downgrade produces a real (possibly refundable) negative delta, never clamped to zero.
- **Listing-conflict detection (the SA-3.4 story)** is real PostGIS polygon-intersection math (`ST_Intersects`/`ST_Overlaps` or equivalent) over each estate's real footprint geometry — this is called out repeatedly in the frontend's design notes as *the* differentiating feature; do not let it degenerate into a bounding-box or distance-heuristic shortcut.
- **Plot geometry**: the frontend's `row`/`col` grid is an acknowledged placeholder for real PostGIS-derived polygons — model plots with real geometry from the start here rather than porting the grid model.
- **No fabricated data, ever, in a response** — if a metric/status genuinely isn't computable yet, the contract is an honest absence (`null`/omitted field/empty page), never a plausible-looking placeholder number. This is a hard rule the frontend team already applies to itself (see recent commits removing hardcoded display numbers) and the backend must not undermine it by inventing figures either.

## Spatial data conventions

These are decisions, not preferences — getting them wrong produces silently wrong numbers rather than errors:

- **Store geometry as SRID 4326** (WGS84 lat/lng), declared as `geometry(Polygon,4326)`. This matches the `GeoPoint` lat/lng shape the frontend already uses for estate footprints.
- **Compute areas via a geography cast**: `ST_Area(footprint::geography)` returns square **metres**. Calling `ST_Area` on raw 4326 geometry returns square **degrees**, which is meaningless for plot sizing and will look like a plausible number.
- **Every geometry column gets a GiST index.** Spatial queries without one degrade to full table scans. The rule above forbidding a bounding-box heuristic in place of real intersection means the real `ST_Intersects` path has to stay fast enough to use.

## Response conventions to match

- **Pagination envelope** (`Page<T>` in `~/landvault/src/lib/pagination.ts`): `{ items: T[], total: number, cursor?: string, hasMore: boolean }`. `cursor` is opaque — the frontend never parses it, so encode it however's convenient (keyset-encoded, base64, etc.). Only genuinely unbounded lists use this; a naturally small/bounded list (e.g. one estate's price tiers) can stay a plain array.
- **Error body**: `{ message?: string, code?: string, fieldErrors?: Record<string,string> }`, with the HTTP status carrying the primary signal (4xx = client error, never retried; 5xx = transient, the frontend retries idempotent/idempotency-keyed requests with backoff).
- Non-idempotent mutations (POST) that the frontend needs retried safely should accept an `Idempotency-Key` header — the frontend's `apiClient` already sends one when it wants that.

See `API_CONTRACT.md` in this repo for the concrete endpoint-by-endpoint surface, derived from every exported function in `~/landvault/src/services/*.ts`.
